## Experiment codes for the paper: "A Design-Space Exploration for Allocating Security Tasks in Multicore Real-Time Systems", accepted for publication, DATE 2018.

#### Link to the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.04808.pdf

### Dependency and prerequisite:

* Make Sure Python 2.7 is installed. This code will not work for Python 3x.
* Install the GPkit Python package. Follow the instructions here: http://gpkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html

* This code is tested with Anaconda Python distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/) and require Python scientific packages. If there is any missing Python package, install using the command:
` pip install <package_name> `


### How to run:

* Navigate to `/src/` directory and tun the main script:
` python mainscript.py `.

    This will output the results in `pickle.gzip` format
